# amdahl-solver
An App for Firefox OS that solves problems in Amdahl's Law.
I created this to help me in solving problems in Amdahl's Law which I find difficult when using pen and paper. At the same time, I submitted it to the Firefox Marketplace back on my Firefox Student Ambassador days. :)

The App can be found at the Firefox Marketplace: https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/amdahl-solver/
